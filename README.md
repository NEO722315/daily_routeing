# daily_routeing
practices_usual
This is the daily practice beetween my learning period which I have snatch skills about programming and the problem I have met in my trianing process.
Including the codes typed by python„ÄÅjava and also shell.I am not familiar with the C,so there is nothing about it.
This respiretory which I am going to renew it about a half year later when I am done with my Postgraduaters Entrance Examing in 12,2020 aims to record the training process which I get through the two years in the head of my colleage time,so,in the point of my view,it is the treasure that become a milestone which mark my time into the amazing programming world for me to say.
So maybe it is not that kind of ,what to say ,professional but I valued it.
